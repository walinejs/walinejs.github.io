The server interface is already equivalent to Valine&#39;s LeanCloud cloud engine.

The spam detection uses the service provided by Akismet abroad, which may be slow to access. Users can turn off the spam detection function through the <code>AKISMET_KEY=false</code> environment variable. Beside the spam detection service, the email notification in the comment notification may also cause a timeout. You can turn off the comment notification to test whether it is caused by this feature.</p>',8);function f(v,g){const t=a("RouteLink");return i(),o("div",null,[m,s("p",null,[r(t,{to:"/en/guide/deploy/deta.html#how-to-update"},{default:l(()=>[d("Deta - How to update?")]),_:1})]),u])}const b=n(p,[["render",f],["__file","faq.html.vue"]]),k=JSON.parse('{"path":"/en/advanced/faq.html","title":"FAQ","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"FAQ","icon":"faq","order":4,"description":"Waline has a very clear position since its birth: A simple comment system with backend.
