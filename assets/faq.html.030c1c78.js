The server interface is already equivalent to Valine&#39;s LeanCloud cloud engine. The server already includes comment management and email notifications feature provided by the previous cloud engine.

The spam detection uses the service provided by Akismet abroad, which may be slow to access. Users can turn off the spam detection function through the <code>AKISMET_KEY=false</code> environment variable. Beside the spam detection service, the email notification in the comment notification may also cause a timeout. You can turn off the comment notification to test whether it is caused by this feature.</p>',8);function f(v,b){const t=d("RouterLink");return n(),i("div",null,[u,o("p",null,[s(t,{to:"/en/guide/deploy/deta.html#how-to-update"},{default:r(()=>[l("Deta - How to update?")]),_:1})]),m])}const g=a(p,[["render",f],["__file","faq.html.vue"]]);export{g as default};
